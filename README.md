## How It Works

### Document Processing Workflow

1. **User uploads documents**
2. **File AI Service** processes and splits documents into chunks
3. **Nomic Embed Text** converts chunks into vector embeddings
4. **Embeddings stored in MongoDB** with user metadata

### Query Processing Workflow

1. **User submits a query** via the chat interface
2. Query is embedded into a vector
3. **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search** retrieves relevant document chunks
4. Chunks are sent to **Llama 2** with a structured prompt
5. **Llama 2** generates a context-aware, structured response
6. Response is displayed in the chat interface
